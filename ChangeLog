2008-12-05 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* VERSION: bumped to 0.2.1
	* Makefile: Minor cleanups
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/cleanupmanager.py: add
	  perform_purge method to clean up zero sized snapshots under 
	  safe circumstances so that the system doesn't become cluttered
	  with too many permanently zero sized snapshots.
	  Rewrote emercency space makeing cleanup alogorithm in run_cleanup  
	  to be more efficient and spawn far fewer shell commands. No longer
	  does recursive snapshot deletion since the above changes will break
	  the recursive snapshot chain in most cases and recursive deletion
	  is now overkill since individual snapshots should be larger in size
	  and yield larger space savings per snapshot deleted.
	  Fixed notification bug where notification would happen twice if
	  gnome-session is launched via dbus-launch.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/deletegui.py: move
	  __get_cloned_snapshots() method to a public function in zfs.py
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/notification.py: fix typo
	  bug in send_to_desktop() where initial warning level was set to
	  90000 which broke desktop notification. Should be 0.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/zfs.py: Add new function:
	  list_cloned_snapshots() to list snapshots that have cloned filesystem
	  based on them.
