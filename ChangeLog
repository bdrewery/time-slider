2010-01-26 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* VERSION: bump to 0.2.96
	* Use explicit path: "/usr/bin/python2.6" to reference python interpreter
	  instead of relying on "/usr/bin/env" to find it.
	* Add plugin framework to enable user defined plugins to be executed after
	  snapshots get taken by time-sliderd. Plugins are based on the SMF service
	  framework and plugins are defined as instances of the base SMV service:
	  svc:/application/time-slider/plugin
	* Provide a "zfs-send" plugin as a replacement for the zfs-auto-snapshot
	  provided "backup-save-cmd" property.
	* Add util.py to define two commoonly used utility functions: debug/logging
	  and command spawning. Reduces lines of code and duplication.
	* Refactor all python files to use util.run_command() convenience function
	  where possible.
	* Fix a bug where time-sliderd emits warnings and tries to cleanup pools
	  upon which it creates no snapshots. Also make time-sliderd more descriminating
	  in general and able to identify snapshots it created from backups of snapshots
	  it create (via zfs send/receive) by checking for the auto-snapshot property
	  corresponding to the filesystem/volume of snapshots.
	* TODO: SMF code is a bit all over the place and could do with proper stucturing

2009-11-27 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/timesliderd.py: fixed a date
	  calculation bug whereby a schedule with a period in months next falls
	  due on December. Was getting incorrectly modulused to 0.

2009-11-04 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* VERSION: bump to 0.2.95
	* Move to python2.6
	* Drop dependency on zfs-auto-snapshot methods and implement our own
	  snapshotting mechanism in the form of time-sliderd
	* Add dbus system bus notification and notification applet, replacing
	  the previous ugly hack of su to logged in user ID and running
	  notify-send.
	* Enhance all .py modules to use python subprocess module when spawning
	  commands instead of os.popen.
	* Add SMF manifest for system/filesystem/auto-snapshot to replace 
	  systems snapshot configuration previously supplied by
	  zfs-auto-snapshot. Generally compatible but cleaned up by dropping
	  some of zfs-auto-snapshot's more quirky or deprecated configuration
	  options.

2009-07-08 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* VERSION: bump to 0.2.10
	* Fix defect 8667 in following source files:
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/cleanupmanager.py: Refactor
	  code to modified zfs.py APIs, remove some dead code, make capacity
	  checks conditional where possible.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/deletegui.py: minor code 
	  refactoring to match zfs.py API changes.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/setupgui.py: Remove references
	  to zfscontroller module which has been removed. Uses zfs.py 
	  exclusively now. Refactor for zfs.py changes
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/zfscontroller.py: removed.
	  Very little functionality and nothing that shouldn't be in zfs.py
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/zfs/py: New class definition
	  for "Datasets" which stores all system snapshots, filesystems and
	  volumes in a cache. Existing Dataset, Filesystem, Snapshot and Volume
	  class methods now use the global Datasets cache for querying and
	  listing instead of making zfs(1m) spawned commands.

2009-05-18 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

        * usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/cleanupmanager.py
          Cleanup both Filesystem and Volume snapshots. Fixes d.o.o 8454
        * usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/setupgui.py: Prepend private
          class methods with "__" in accordance with python coding standards.
        * usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/smfmanager.py: Use predefined
          macros for ZFS commands instead of hardcoding path in the code.
        * usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/zfs.py: Improve object
          hierarchy and inheritance tree. Rename some methods for improved
          clarity of purpose. Improve method and function documentation.
          Add capability to deal with ZFS volumes. Fixes d.o.o 8454 & 8685

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/zfscontroller.py:
	  Use macro substitution to specify full paths to all spawned
	  commands (zfs, zpool, svcadm, svccfg, svcprop, pfexec) so that
	  commands work independently of user's PATH environment.
	  Fixes opensolaris defect #7396

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/setupgui.py: Allow filesystems
	  to inherit properties from their parent instead of locally tagging
	  every filesystem with the required property setting.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/zfs.py: Add an "inherit" argument
	  to Filesystem.commit_state() to allow the fileystem to inherit from
	  it's parent when setting the auto-snapshot property.

	  with too many permanently zero sized snapshots.
	  Rewrote emercency space makeing cleanup alogorithm in run_cleanup  
	  to be more efficient and spawn far fewer shell commands. No longer
	usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/setupgui.py: Change error dialog text to

  does recursive snapshot deletion since the above changes will break
	  the recursive snapshot chain in most cases and recursive deletion
	  is now overkill since individual snapshots should be larger in size
	  and yield larger space savings per snapshot deleted.
	  Fixed notification bug where notification would happen twice if
	  gnome-session is launched via dbus-launch.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/deletegui.py: move

	  list_cloned_snapshots() to list snapshots that have cloned filesystem
	  based on them.
