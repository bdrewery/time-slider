2010-04-16 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/zfs.py: Fix bug in 
	  method "create_auto_snapshot_set() where it would skip
	  the entire pool if the root of the pool was tagged and 
	  all datastets under the root inherited from it. Also,
	  use sorted lists and binary searching to speed up the
	  operation and avoid making repeated unnecessary calls
	  to Dataset.list_children() (the data is already provided)

2010-04-15 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/plugin/rsync/backup.py: Clean up 
	  dangling holds on snapshots left by abnormally terminated
	  rsync transfers from previous invocations. Also, release
	  snapshot holds if an Rsync exception is caught during
	  transfer. Allows time-sliderd to delete snapshots when they
	  naturally expire.

2010-04-13 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/setupgui.py:
	  Fix broken target directory retrieval from FileChooser button

2010-04-13 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/plugin/rsync/backup.py: Create a
	  RsyncBackup class to run rsync backup commands in a 
	  separate thread. Define Rsync exception clases and map
	  to expected rsync exit codes.
	  Modify toplevel backup path for backups to begin with:
	  <SMF defined target dir>/TIMESLIDER/<nodename>/
	  Deal with rsync exceptions raised and place into maintenance
	  state if non recoverable.
	  Try to recover space on target directory (work in progress)
	  Add debugging and error logging output.

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/plugin/rsync/rsyncsmf.py: define
	  backup RSYNCDIRPREFIX to "TIMESLIDER".

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/util.py:
	  Add general purpose syslog wrapper function.

	* var/svc/manifest/application/time-slider-plugin.xml:
	  remove accidental definition of <plugin/target_dir>
	  Set to empty string value "" instead of a directory on my
	  own system. Doh.

2010-04-01 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/timesliderd.py: insert a
	  'h' character between hour and minute values of auto snapshot
	  labels as a subsitute for the previously removed ':' character
	  used in time stamps. Makes life easier for nautilus component
	  and plays nicely with strptime()

2010-04-01 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/applet.py: gio FileMonitor
	  events are inconsistent between UFS/ZFS filesystem mounting.
	  Ignore event type from gio FileMonitor and verify backup target
	  status manually using os.stat()

2010-04-01 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/applet.py: Improve string
	  formatting on notifications and tooltips. Stop the status icon
	  blinking once the notification has been closed.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/setupgui.py: Forgot to
	  connect rsync folder selection to rsync SMF instance
	  configuration. Added. Also use get_current_folder() instead of
	  get_filename() to get correct folder from FileChooserButton
	  widget.

2010-03-31 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/applet.py: Restrict manual
	  synchronisation menu item to priviliged users only (root or
	  users assigned Primary Administrator profile). Also, don't
	  bother popping up a right click menu if it's empty.

2010-03-31 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/plugin/rsync/backup.py: Implement cleanup
	  of expired backups on rsync target directory. Uses same rules as
	  time-slider as defined by each auto-snapshot schedule's SMF instance
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/plugin/rsync/rsyncsmf.py: Add a method to
	  return the list of archived schedules (ie. ones that don't get 
	  cleaned according to the normal schedule retention rules)
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/applet.py: add a 
	  'Synchronize Now' menu item to the applet. Added gio based file
	  monitoring to keep track of when the rsync backup target directory
	  is mounted/unmounted and adjust menu sensitivty accordingly.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/autosnapsmf.py: Define 
	  SNAPLABELPREFIX as a constant for snapshot label names
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/setupgui.py: Modify RBAC
	  rules to ensure that setup GUI is run with euid of root which is
	  necessary for validation and initialisation of rsync backup target
	  directory
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/timesliderd.py: use 
	  SNAPLABELPREFIX constant instead of local multiply defined values.
	* var/svc/manifest/application/time-slider-plugin.xml: Override
	  "plugin/trigger_on" value in rsync plugin manifest. Add a new
	  property "rsync/archived_schedules" to define snapshot schedules
	  that are archived as long as possible and not purged according
	  to the normal schule retention rules.

2010-03-25 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	  rsync plugin's dbus service and methods.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/plugin/rsync/backup.py: restructure script
	  to perform backups via a Gobject mainloop which is necessary to allow
	  it to send dbus notifications correctly. Adjust backup target dir
	  to use a rsync plugin specific subdirectory on the target dir
	  (.time-slider/rsync) - prevents borkage of mount points with 
	  unmounted filesystems. Use "-a" option with rsync command which 
	  covers all the desired arguments fo our rsync usage case (archival)
	  Add dbus method invocations. General cleanup and removal of commented
	  out code. Use lockfile to prevent multiple instances running at once.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/plugin/rsync/rsyncsmf.py: Add definitions

	  RsyncNote class and other pieces from Krishnan Parthasarathi. Thanks
	  Krishan. Added signal handlers and tooltips/popups for dbus events 
	  sent from rsync plugin.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/dbussvc.py: New dbus signal
	  definitions added, including a few from Krishnan.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/setupgui.py: Perform validation
	  on target directory for rsync. Not exhaustive yet. Checks that target
	  directory isn't on a file system or pool that's been selected for
	  automatic snapshots.

	  that non trivial plugin instances should provide their
	  own specific methods.

2010-02-03 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* var/svc/manifest/application/time-slider.xml:
	  Define new property "zfs/sep". Taken for zfs-auto-snapshot,
	  allows custom definition of a separator character for snapshot
	  datestamps that can work on filesystems that previously choked
	  on the ":" characted such as CIFS, PCFS.

2010-01-26 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* VERSION: bump to 0.2.96
	* Use explicit path: "/usr/bin/python2.6" to reference python interpreter
	  instead of relying on "/usr/bin/env" to find it.
	* Add plugin framework to enable user defined plugins to be executed after
	  snapshots get taken by time-sliderd. Plugins are based on the SMF service
	  framework and plugins are defined as instances of the base SMV service:
	  svc:/application/time-slider/plugin
	* Provide a "zfs-send" plugin as a replacement for the zfs-auto-snapshot
	  provided "backup-save-cmd" property.
	* Add util.py to define two commoonly used utility functions: debug/logging
	  and command spawning. Reduces lines of code and duplication.
	* Refactor all python files to use util.run_command() convenience function
	  where possible.
	* Fix a bug where time-sliderd emits warnings and tries to cleanup pools
	  upon which it creates no snapshots. Also make time-sliderd more descriminating
	  in general and able to identify snapshots it created from backups of snapshots
	  it create (via zfs send/receive) by checking for the auto-snapshot property
	  corresponding to the filesystem/volume of snapshots.
	* TODO: SMF code is a bit all over the place and could do with proper stucturing

2009-11-27 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/timesliderd.py: fixed a date
	  calculation bug whereby a schedule with a period in months next falls
	  due on December. Was getting incorrectly modulused to 0.

2009-11-04 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* VERSION: bump to 0.2.95
	* Move to python2.6
	* Drop dependency on zfs-auto-snapshot methods and implement our own
	  snapshotting mechanism in the form of time-sliderd
	* Add dbus system bus notification and notification applet, replacing
	  the previous ugly hack of su to logged in user ID and running
	  notify-send.
	* Enhance all .py modules to use python subprocess module when spawning
	  commands instead of os.popen.
	* Add SMF manifest for system/filesystem/auto-snapshot to replace 
	  systems snapshot configuration previously supplied by
	  zfs-auto-snapshot. Generally compatible but cleaned up by dropping
	  some of zfs-auto-snapshot's more quirky or deprecated configuration
	  options.

2009-07-08 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

	* VERSION: bump to 0.2.10

	  Very little functionality and nothing that shouldn't be in zfs.py
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/zfs/py: New class definition
	  for "Datasets" which stores all system snapshots, filesystems and
	  volumes in a cache. Existing Dataset, Filesystem, Snapshot and Volume
	  class methods now use the global Datasets cache for querying and
	  listing instead of making zfs(1m) spawned commands.

2009-05-18 Niall Power - <niall.power@sun.com>

        * usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/cleanupmanager.py

        * usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/setupgui.py: Prepend private
          class methods with "__" in accordance with python coding standards.
        * usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/smfmanager.py: Use predefined
          macros for ZFS commands instead of hardcoding path in the code.
        * usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/zfs.py: Improve object
          hierarchy and inheritance tree. Rename some methods for improved
          clarity of purpose. Improve method and function documentation.
          Add capability to deal with ZFS volumes. Fixes d.o.o 8454 & 8685

	  every filesystem with the required property setting.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/zfs.py: Add an "inherit" argument
	  to Filesystem.commit_state() to allow the fileystem to inherit from

  does recursive snapshot deletion since the above changes will break
	  the recursive snapshot chain in most cases and recursive deletion
	  is now overkill since individual snapshots should be larger in size
	  and yield larger space savings per snapshot deleted.
	  Fixed notification bug where notification would happen twice if
	  gnome-session is launched via dbus-launch.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/deletegui.py: move
	  __get_cloned_snapshots() method to a public function in zfs.py
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/notification.py: fix typo
	  bug in send_to_desktop() where initial warning level was set to
	  90000 which broke desktop notification. Should be 0.
	* usr/share/time-slider/lib/time_slider/zfs.py: Add new function:
	  list_cloned_snapshots() to list snapshots that have cloned filesystem
	  based on them.
